The summary doesn't do justice to the book's actual plot. This story wasn't just about Jack; it was about the many people in the town whose lives and relationships were intertwined. One thing I really loved about this story was the relationship between Torin and Sidra. Sometimes, you can tell which character's story an author is really passionate about telling. Their relationship on the paper felt real and tangible, and they had very realistic emotions and fleshed-out dialogues.However, since Jack is the main character in this novel, I was terribly disappointed in the way he was regarded as a side character. His romance with Adaira felt very frustrating because I genuinely couldn't feel the chemistry between the characters. I felt like the author just shoved the enemies-to-lovers trope in our faces. It didn't feel real or fleshed out properly, and I kept comparing their relationship to that of Torin and Sidra (which left me wanting more). In fact, at the end, I was a bit relieved when Adaira decided to leave Jack to remain in the west (or east?) I forgot which side they were on.In the end, I will definitely get a paper copy of this book to keep at home.

I off and on found her annoying because she was so pretty and peppy so I was so surprised to be able to relate to her. The abuse she went through, the dysfunctional narcissistic family, the relationship with her sister, and the pregnancy loss I understood and felt for her. (Minus the fame and money) I did feel bad about her being so obviously exploited and what the media said was horrible. But how she was able to get through it and get out of the conservatorship, which FYI is only $1,000 for her family to muzzle her with. The book was just eye opening and sad how many who are in the spotlight don't seem to have any real foundation, especially child stars. I wish her much happiness and GOOD adventures to come in her life. I hope her freedom finally allows her to heal.FYI I listened to the version on Audible, which really helped because I have ADHD.

As a result, it was a little difficult for me to get intoThank you for the ARC Alice!This was the first zombie/post-apocalyptic book I'd ever read. As a result, it was a little difficult for me to get into the book at first. However, as I continued reading, the book piqued my interest, and I've come to enjoy it.The author's writing and storytelling were great. It conveyed a consistent tone of the characters' need for survival in a post-apocalyptic world without being overly explained or complicated. The book had a great balance of ""show and tell,"" and I especially enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the gnashers/biters, the post-apocalyptic world, and the overall atmosphere of the book as a whole.This was extremely helpful in visualising what was going on as I was reading, which I believe is what eventually made the book such a good read for me.I liked Sara and Cat's relationship and trust; my little gay heart can't help but root for them throughout the book. Also, the dual POVs worked so well in this book, it allows the reader to get to know Sara and Cat as complete individual characters.The ending!...the ending left me wanting more. Already desperate for a sequel to this book, I want to know what happens next....more",not set,not set,"Sep 06, 2022",Kindle Edition,"Aug 31, 2022"

The color purpleThe color purple was very difficult for me to read. Not only that I had a hard time adapting to the slang but it was also very real. The color purple would deal with very hard issues in very short and simple ways. It was a very real and raw book giving you no fluff, putting you right in that time and how it was. I would suggest this to someone who is mature. I would not suggest this book to someone who is not ready to know about different forms of sexuality and rape. This story connected with me. Not in the way that I could relate at all but, the writing was so brilliant that I didn’t need to have a correlation to any of the main issues. The reason I gave this book four starts is that I had a really hard time reading it personally because of the slang....more",not set,not set,"May 11, 2017",Paperback,"Apr 01, 2004"

It showed me how bad things are in cities like Pakistan and Kabul really were and how much it could change. At first Amir in Kabul as a young boy and he did have a young boy views on things with his innocence but he also didn’t shy away from what he saw. From all of the discrimination and poverty the Hazzar social standards were with Hassan and Ali. Then to when he came back just straight massacres and raids upon everyone. How the Taliban did not mercy anyone even Rahim was discriminated against for shouting to loud at a soccer game. The Kite Runner also showed me that people need to forgive themselves. Amir never truly forgives himself for not stopping what happened to Hassan. He blames himself even more throughout time when he finds out that Hassan is his half-brother. Then by doing right with talking in Soharb and telling him “for you anything.” Taking care of Soharb just as much as Hassan loved Amir....more",not set,not set,"Feb 23, 2017",Paperback,May 2004

I would have to set time aside to read this because once I started it was hard to put back down. It was not a book that I could just casually pull out and read for five minutes.Yes, it was very similar to other books that had dystopian societies but I never liked those books. I think the interesting part for me was the way the dystopian society was presented by Mafi. In other books that I have read the society has been brought up in a blunt manner that was predictable. While in shatter me the world and how it is now to Juliet was brought up in her story through; metaphors, similes, and strange descriptions. That was one thing that also kept me so into the book was discovering the meaning/ my meaning of the metaphors and similes. I find it so much more interesting and personal to put your own thoughts into what the author is trying to say....more",not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2017",Hardcover,"Nov 15, 2011"

When I read the cover and got an idea before I read it, I thought it was going to be just another Ya Ya sisterhood type deal with having strength in sister to sister. Which in time it was but not to par with the stereotype I had in mind. Sue Monk Kidd's words flowed like a little southern girl melody in my head. I fell in love with all of the characters especially May with her O Susana song, pesto bismole house, and very own weeping wall. I also loved how April played a big role in the Boatwright sisters lives but never said one word. I was not as big as a fan of Lilly, not when she narrated but when she first explained herself to the Boatwright or just her little lies that she told. She was just such a bad liar it made me cringe sometimes. My favorite part of the book is that one crazy hot day in South Carolina and all you were so post to do on those days was sleep. Then come to see May and Rosaleen skipping around in the water then to attack August and Lilly, then June who laughed and lay with Lilly then broke the ice for that memory with a hug.

I wa**spoiler alert** Before I begin I would like to say that I am not a “reader” I normally do not go out of my way to read for fun with most books. I was drawn to Speak because of the realism aspects that it was said to have but, I also thought in reading it there were many unrealistic aspects. One was how overly the characters were brought out being set in stone to a stereotype. How every character in the school overly fit that group. For example, the art teacher was an overly suffering artist with too much passion and the English teacher has crazy hair and only focused on the symbolism of books. Giving the book a feel of a teen outcast poor me a basic young adult book. Although, I did enjoy the fact of how Melinda was not given specific characteristics so it was up to the reader to piece together the rest of her look. I never really felt an extreme climax or fall in the book either it was all about one monotone wave. I loved how the book was written in the way that Melinda had her voice through the book but, the main revile or event was not a huge part in the book. I also already knew that she had gotten raped before the big reveal so when it was told I was not shocked. I also thought that the message displayed in being in that situation was not a positive message for young girls. Knowing two people in my life that have been through the same situation it does not do it justice. At the end, you do not come clean and feel better and or more empower by telling. If anything it brings up the whole situation again and reliving the unbearable situation. This book should not have ended with a pretty bow “oh now I can speak” ending. I loved most of the book and the bits of humor kept me reading it the ending just really frustrated me....more",not set,not set,"Nov 01, 2016",Paperback,"Apr 01, 2001"

Normally when I’m assigned a book in English I end up hating it and just use spark notes to learn the whole story but in the case of Ender’s game I loved it! This book is very exciting and I couldn’t put it down. Enders game has a simple enough story that is easy to follow yet has so much depth to it. Part way through the book I had forgotten how old Ender was I assumed he was around the age of 12 but going back and finding out he was only 6 was surprising. Usually when there is a child in a book being trained to save the world they are at least 12. But these kids are 6. It shows just how truly brilliant Ender is for a 6-year-old. The main story line was extremely creative and beautifully executed. The whole beginning of the book is about Ender training in battle games to be able to be leader. But then the ending even though it felt a little rushed was excellent. It was a surprise twist that sums the book up so well. It shows just how clever yet ruthless the leaders of the world are. And it really shows how great of a character Ender is.

I've read about impossible revolutions before, and people with superpowers making the revolution a reality, and it just didn't seem like it was setting itself apart from that kind of dystopian revolution genre. I think that where my interest was piqued was during Vin's time at the noblemen balls. I thought that they were more intense and stressful than the planning of the revolution was, especially during her last ball. While that part was interesting, and it was fun for a while, the book ultimately ended exactly like I predicted it would. There were not very many surprises, and I never feared for the main character life because their insurance was that they were the main character. It was a interesting, while predictable, story, and their superhuman concepts were intriguing as well, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't followed the rules of all the other young adult novels out there.

When I put it down I would just wonder what was happening next to Ender. Although I had already watched the movie, and knew how it ended, it still didn't cushion the blow when I read the tragic end of the ""Games"". What bugged me through the entire book was the fact that Ender and his siblings were all so incredibly smart. I am sure that there are plenty of smart kids out there, but how did they end up that way? Is the world Ender lives in so scientifically advanced that they don't see a need for ethics? I have four younger brothers, and let me tell you, not one of them by the age of six was as smart or capable as Ender. They don't have their minds set on things like war and tactics. It says somewhere in the book that they used genetics to enhance their learning capacity, but I can't help but wonder what kind of human experimentation had to be done to get to that point in the first place. It's said that medicine would not be as advanced as it is now if we didn't have Auschwitz human experimentation then we would not be as advanced as we are now. So was it a necessary evil?

In the beginning I felt kind of violated reading the explicit bits, but the philosophy and the style were enough to make up for that. I didn't live back when this took place, I don't know when it took place, but I felt transported to the time. There wasn't a ton of description, nothing to describe where they were or what they looked like, but I feel like through the style that it is written in you are shown those things without explicitly saying it outright. I really appreciated how separated everyone was. Once you were given away to be married your family became a distant memory. For Celie this seemed more of a blessing than a curse because of what happened to her before she was married. The progression of this book was amazing, we see how her personal strength grows, and how she finally finds herself. I like how we see symbols of her new power. For example *spoiler* her pants. And how she shares her pants with the people around her. She goes from being a lowly wife who is underappreciated, maybe even hated, to someone that everyone in the book finds strength in. There was one issue that I had with the book, and I feel if it hadn't been there that the book would have been more enjoyable. The people in my book group know what I am talking about. There were quite a few things I liked about the book, but my favorite was probably the philosophy about God. The quote that gave the book its name was about such philosophy, and I absolutely loved it. Well there's my two cents.

Chris's adventures across america and then up to Alaska made the book really interesting and brought his adventure into my own home. The layout of the book was very interesting, however. Never have I ever read a book where the main character dies in the second chapter, and I must say that it took some of the surprise out of the ending. The part of the book that keeps the reader reading is the stories of adventure that Chris shares, and the fact that it is a true story, and not in any way made up. The author mixes in some of his own stories of adventures too which, at times are random, but still interesting. The most interesting part to me personally, is the amount of work that went in to uncover Chris's story and to find everyone that associated with him....more",not set,not set,"May 15, 2017",Paperback,"Feb 01, 1997"

At times, it seems as though everything is fine, and right when you don't expect it something goes wrong. As I read this book, I could relate to each person who made their way into the story one way or another. Amir's journey from being a young, naive rich boy to a mature, accountable adult grabs the readers attention making it impossible to set the book down. Throughout this book, the reader can feel Amir's highs and lows, the betrayal by friends and family, and the suspense of the unforeseen future. I really loved this book and the characters in it. It helped me to both understand the Afghan culture and develop a passion for writing myself. I could easily put myself in Amir's shoes while reading this, making the book even more grabbing.

Frankl truly is an amazing writer and this book may have changed my life slightly. That being said, the moment I hit part II of this book, all of these feelings died down. Maybe it is because I am a mere high school student, but every single word started flying hundreds of feet over my head. I don’t mean this in a diminishing way at all.

This book contains so many necessary and important secrets to success, that I wonder why it isn’t required for everyone to read this book. This inspirational novel gives life lessons and secrets to success through ten different scrolls. Two of the scrolls that stuck out most to me were the third scroll, which is “success comes from persistence” and the seventh scroll which is “laugh often”.Earlier this year, I was given this book by my dad. Inside he wrote about how he read this book when he was my age and that it entirely changed the way he thought. He explained how it sparked his “business side” of his mind, and that he wants the same for me. I can honestly say that it did the same thing for me.

Amir lived with guilt for years and I like that the way the he sought out for repentance was to use that same line.

I liked how there was humor in the book also because sometimes it made me laugh and that just made the book overall more interesting and entertaining.

I loved how it left myself with so many questions and it made me want to keep reading to see what the answers were, although this part of the book was amazing I never found another part in the book that really met up to those expectations. I felt like the rest of the book was good, but not that good. I was waiting for it to be as good as the beginning but it never reached and grabbed my attention like that opening scene. I feel like there were way too many pauses in the book. There were a lot of breaks in sentences and I like that sometimes and it makes it more interesting to use, but I feel like there was way too much of that it was basically throughout the whole entire book.

As AlanWhile I found parts of this book a touch dated, several insights prompted me to pause, re-read, and reflect on my own shame and insecurities. As Alan Downs writes, growing up gay in a straight man's world does present a very specific set of challenges for gay men to overcome (or, as many of us approach it, overcompensate for).""When you drop the struggle with shame and accept life as it is without judgment, you find great freedom on the other side. It is freedom to be who you are, exactly as you are. The only real meaning in life is found in being who you are right now, without apologies.""The relief I felt when reading these words! I suddenly felt permission to let go of harmful perfectionist standards and anxieties around what others may think of my choices. What a powerful moment!After spending time in therapy myself, I appreciate that this book echoes several of the takeaways that have most helped me: Accept reality as it is rather than as you believe it should be, challenge yourself to recognize and acknowledge your own judgments, validate the feelings of others because everyone's feelings *are* valid.I will agree that the target demographic of gay man for this book may be somewhat narrow, but I do believe that any gay man will find at least a few wonderfully useful takeaways from this book....more","Apr 21, 2020","Apr 24, 2020","Apr 23, 2020",Paperback,"May 30, 2006"

The author must certainly have spent time practicing and becoming the voice of the natural world.What struck me most was how the natural world (and, specifically, trees) approach time. The first 150 pages or so of the book introduce us to nine main characters, my favorite definitely being Patricia Westerford. In many of their stories, we journey through family histories that go back over 100 years. Using tree-like transitions to describe the passage of time, we're able to jump decades into the future, what should feel like a significant leap, in the calming, nurturing words of nature, through seasons and tree lifecycles.After being introduced to the main characters, their journeys begin slowly connecting. In short, many of them become eco-activists, hoping to save the three percent of old growth forest left in the country, most of which lies in the Pacific Northwest, from deforestation.While I enjoyed all of the characters, I learned the most from Patricia. A pioneering forestry scientist, she makes remarkable discoveries as a young researcher and decides to publish her findings that trees communicate with each other in many different ways. Post publication, the natural science community completely dismisses her, some even suggesting she's become unhinged. She retreats into a largely lonely life. Over the years that follow, her discoveries are vindicated by additional data, which leads to the publication of her book.(Insert book name that I can't remember)becomes *the* definitive book on trees. She then settles into her role as a researcher and occasional public speaker, bringing much greater public awareness to forests and trees. I learned so much from her character's reverence of the natural world.I have a strong feeling this will be one of those books I become nostalgic for when I see it on the bookshelf in years to come.

Jael ist ein Electos, er fühlt nichts und beraubt Menschen ihrer Gefühle und Xenia ist ein Immunit, sie hört bei jeder Berührung Geräusche, außer bei Jael, was heißt das für die Beziehung der beiden?Bei Jael und Xenia handelt es sich um die Protagonisten des Buches. Aber auch die Geschichten der anderen neuen Schüler spielen eine wichtige Rolle.Grundsätzlich war das Buch ein solider Fantasy-Roman. Vor einigen Jahren hätte mich die Geschichte sicher noch mehr abgeholt, als es nun der Fall war (vielleicht bin ich mit meinen 24 Jahren schon zu alt;)). Für mich war das Buch zu Beginn ein wenig schleppend, wurde von Seite zu Seite jedoch besser. Der Schreibstil war flüssig und schön geschrieben. Dem Geschehen war leicht zu folgen und ich war mittendrin in der Geschichte. Ein wenig störte mich jedoch der häufige Wechsel und die vielen verschiedenen Perspektiven und die dadurch entstehende Wiederholung der Story. Aber das ist sicherlich Geschmacksache.Die Grundidee der Geschichte finde ich noch immer super, jedoch fehlte mir ein wenig die Action....more","May 12, 2021","May 16, 2021","May 04, 2021",Hardcover,"May 25, 2021"

In CareerBerührende Einblicke in ein Leben im RampenlichtBill Kaulitz ist Sänger der Band Tokio Hotel, kaum eine Person polarisiert so stark, wie er. In Career Suicide, seiner Autobiographie, blickt er auf die ersten 30 Jahre seines Lebens zurück.Ich bin mit ihnen aufgewachsen, habe Konzerte besucht und verfolge noch immer gern das Leben der vier Jungs, die mich die letzten 15 Jahre meines Lebens begleitet haben.Die Autobiografie von Bill Kaulitz war somit ein Muss für mich. Ich habe mich seit Monaten darauf gefreut dieses Buch in den Händen zu halten und endlich zu erfahren, wie sein Leben vor dem Erfolg war, wie das Leben eines so jungen Menschen durch den Erfolg verändert wird, was macht der Erfolg aus einer so jungen Seele? Bill schreibt in einer sehr persönlichen Art und Weise über seine Kindheit, den Erfolg und das Leben in der Musikszene, wie es ist Anders als die anderen zu sein, belächelt zu werden und auch von dem Hass, den er erfahren musste.Ich tauchte ab in seine Zeilen, die so ähnlich wie ein Tagebuch geschrieben sind, so voller Emotionen, Ehrlichkeit, Witz und mich ab der ersten Seite in den Bann zogen. Er hat mich mit seinen Worten abgeholt und mich so viele verschiedene Emotionen fühlen lassen, während ich sein Buch las. Ich konnte das Buch gar nicht weglegen und wollte mehr und immer mehr über den Mann erfahren, der mich von der ersten Sekunde, als ich „Durch den Monsun“ 2005 zum ersten Mal hörte, fasziniert hat.Seine schonungslos ehrliche Art zu schreiben, nichts schönzureden und uns als Leser an seinen vergangenen 30 Jahren teilhaben zu lassen, bewundere ich und es zeigt uns, dass Anderssein auch schön sein kann, wir sollen für unsere Träume kämpfen und uns von niemandem unterkriegen lassen!Ich kann dieses Buch nur weiterempfehlen!...more","Jan 30, 2021","Feb 02, 2021","Jan 26, 2021",Hardcover,"Jan 04, 2021"

Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,"Dai, Sijie",Invalid rating,61103873,0385722206,"66,659",3.64,184pp,"Upon reading Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, I was in a place of disconcerment. After looking up what the story was about, it sounded anythiUpon reading Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, I was in a place of disconcerment. After looking up what the story was about, it sounded anything but interesting. Personally, I do not enjoy reading books, but after reading this book, I was able to look at life differently. A book that makes you think about decisions that led you up to reading this review, filled with many side stories, this book will have you on your toes and to not ever want to put it down to stop reading.The story begins with two boys getting sent to a mountain to get “reeducated.” The boys' chances to go back to the city are very slim, and many instances with their journey on the mountain replicate this. One purpose of this book is to show loyalty, through the good and bad of it. It is something that can go both ways, and is something that is ever present in the story. In perspective, this book shows how history has affected many people living today. We see how the two boys have traumatic experiences thirty years later, after their experiences on the mountain.My first reaction to the book came when the Narrator got jealous over Luo and the Little Seamstress. Because of this, we see how the Narrator starts to slowly become Luo’s sidekick. It is not until after the Narrator reads a life changing book from the “hidden suitcase” filled with many banned Chinese books. After this, the Narrator has his “coming of age”, and starts to become dependent on himself, and not rely on others. I believe that this instance replicates life itself, and how one thing, like the book itself, can change a person for the better.What struck me noteworthy was that because of Luo, and how he wanted to reeducate her, she accomplishes this, which is what the entire book is about after looking back at it. She is an example of a generation of rural young people who have been exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking by urban elites who have been stationed among them in order to be ""re-educated,"" so does the exact opposite from what is expected.This book itself represents the coming of age to myself. I would consider this book from the “hidden suitcase” as it made me realize things that I had previously not thought about. This book was effective in making me about all my previous decisions, and how if I made one different decision, even one, my life could be completely different. This book made me realize how fortunate I am to have the life that I can experience. Many people, like the two boys, were forced to do something that they could not control. This is something that is scary to think about, as I don’t know what I would do if something like this were to happen to me.This book is intended for all audiences. I can’t see many reasons for people to dislike the book. This book was a journey that I did not want to end. This book will open the eyes for anyone reading. The author did a great job with describing and designing pictures in my head to better understand the story. I would rate this book five stars....more",not set,not set,"Dec 17, 2020",Paperback,"Oct 29, 2002"

Storie del secolo breve,Alberto Di girolamo*,5,61103899,8899964386,4,5.00,192pp,"Esistono tempi in cui la realtà si fa troppo complessa per la Tradizione Orale. Ma la Leggenda le conferisce una forma attraverso la quale pervade ilEsistono tempi in cui la realtà si fa troppo complessa per la Tradizione Orale. Ma la Leggenda le conferisce una forma attraverso la quale pervade il mondo intero.(Alphaville-JEAN-LUC GODARD)Ci sono messaggi che dividono, racconti come quelli che vi accennerò nelle prossime righe che vorrebbero parlare a tutti, ma quasi per condizioni di esistenza arrivano solo a metà e l’altra metà della storia siete voi lettori.Le storie vere o verosimili come queste non possono scalfire la scorza di chi si è già fatto un’opinione, di chi ha già in mente schemi e categorie sociali in cui incastonare tutto ciò che gli si presenta davanti. Stiamo parlando della vita reale incasellata perfettamente in un libro.Dopo aver letto questo romanzo i viaggi nel tempo dilagheranno in letteratura e nelle altre forme di narrazione, ma sempre dovranno confrontarsi con lo spaesamento e la vertigine di un tempo differente sotto il quale, il più delle volte, si cela il presente stesso. Questo è lo spirito di questo libro.La narrazione come in film reale vi porterà indietro come se oggi fosse ieri.“…respirai, strinsi i denti, impugnai con ambo le mani la leva di partenza e la spinsi…” (Time MachineH. G. Wells).Da sempre le pagine di romanzi, poemi e cronache risuonano dei passi di una folla di viaggiatori: eroi omerici che vanno in guerra o peregrinano per mare; poeti che si addentrano negli Inferi; mercanti curiosi che raccontano i loro viaggi; cavalieri impegnati in imprese che vanno molto al di là della loro portata; sposi promessi costretti a lasciarsi.Tutti hanno in comune il fatto di essere diretti a una meta: un luogo, uno scopo o uno scopo che coincide con un luogo o un bisogno. Non importa che il luogo esista oppure no, non importa che il bisogno esista oppure no.C’è un solo viaggio che noi umani in carne e ossa non siamo ancora riusciti a fare: quello di tornare indietro nel tempo, un viaggio verso un altrove che non è solo un luogo, ma anche, e soprattutto, un tempo. Un tempo diverso, lontano dal presente decine e decine di anni.Alberto Di Girolamo con il suo libro “Storie del secolo breve”, riesce in questo, riportandoci magistralmente all’inizio dl XX° secolo.Il viaggio in questo libro resta una vertigine mentale e come tale è un potente, e quasi inesauribile, motore creativo che ha fatto, e fa, partorire le storie narrate.L’autore è in grado di creare un fertile humus per gente dotata di immaginazione.Proprio per il suo estremo fascino creativo saremmo portati a credere che esistano narrazioni come queste che io definirei reali.D’altronde, le situazioni narrate sono quasi uniche e credo non si trovino nemmeno nel patrimonio mitico e leggendario, che è il bagaglio principale dal quale scrittori e poeti dell’antichità attingevano le loro storie. Insomma, definirei Alberto Di Girolamo uno scrittore e un poeta di altri tempi.Alberto Di Girolamo vi farà conoscere la realtà degli uomini che si spezzano la schiena per estrarre pietre da costruzione. Vi farà conoscere i loro sentimenti più profondi, vi farà capire cosa è l’ingordigia, l’invidia, la vendetta, sentimenti che tutti conoscete bene, ma che difficilmente ammetterete di avere. Vi farà capire gli errori commessi per amore. Vi accompagnerà tra i contrabbandieri. Vi farà commettere gli stessi errori dei protagonisti. Tutto questo e molto dippiù è narrato in maniera ineccepibile dall’autore.I dialoghi tra i vari personaggi sono spontanei e veri come quelli che si fanno in barberia sulla guerra in Libia, veri e propri pettegolezzi, che ravvivano la narrazione.Fin dalle prime pagine “Storie del secolo breve” si dimostra un romanzo diverso dai soliti lavori di genere. In primo luogo per il ritmo ampio e posato, che si snoda attraverso luoghi ed episodi intrecciati con intelligenza. Poi per il linguaggio ricercato, che dimostra un’attenta programmazione del lavoro e un alto livello professionale. E infine per l’atmosfera, che scaturisce da una raffinata ricostruzione di culture e di affreschi d’ambiente, descritti con precisione.L’aria che si respira è quella dei grandi best seller, dei capolavori capaci di grande presa sul pubblico, letterariamente godibili, frutto di un accurato lavoro preparatorio, di studi e ricerche non occasionali.La narrazione porta il lettore ad andare fino in fondo al romanzo senza interruzione alcuna.Così come sublimi sono i sobbalzi spazio-temporali che l’autore crea in maniera ineccepibile e che rendono la narrazione stessa più interessante.Leggendo questo libro vi ritroverete sicuramente dentro un sogno, il Sogno della Coscienza. Sarà come essere dentro una Proiezione Olografica, la proiezione della Coscienza.In poche parole è un libro da non perdere.Ora “Sorridi”. E quando avrai un momento di smarrimento o indecisione, fermati, aspetta e senti il tuo cuore.…a mia figlia Miriam con infinito amore…vito ditaranto....more","Jul 18, 2017","Jul 25, 2017","Jul 25, 2017",Paperback,2017

L’autrice tramite le pagine del romanzo è riuscita a far emergere splendidamente questa problematica; la Groenlandia, infatti, è il paese con il più alto tasso di suicidi e nonostante ciò non si hanno statistiche aggiornate riguardo a tale fenomeno e non si hanno opportuni aiuti e supporti. Persone che tentano il suicidio sono considerate come persone che non sanno vivere e vengono persino cacciate dalle abitazioni dello studentato. Le persone incaricate a fornire una rete di supporto se ne lavano le mani perché “Non è che possiamo riempire l’ospedale di giovani che prendono pillole, non c’è abbastanza posto”.“La gente ti sta a sentire ma poi non ti ascolta veramente!”, è questa la dura verità.Il libro è formato da tre parti: Loro, Tu, Io. La prima parte è divisa da dei paragrafi numerati a cui corrisponde un suicidio ciascuno. I paragrafi di tutte le parti vengono numerati in senso decrescente in modo da creare una sorta di countdown fino all’arrivo dell’estremo gesto della protagonista che chiude il romanzo....more","Aug 28, 2023","Aug 29, 2023","Jul 17, 2023",Paperback,"Jun 28, 2023"

Un memoir che racconta di una Francia degli anni ‘60, estremamente classista e in cui l’aborto era illegale e trattato come un reato. Le donne erano perciò obbligate ad abortire clandestinamente andando incontro a molteplici rischi. Annie Ernaux racconta la sua esperienza in modo molto vivido, non tralasciando i silenzi dei medici, la paura nell’affidarsi ad una sconosciuta, la solitudine provata e l’abbandono.Fu così che si ritrovò a cercare una “fabbricante di angeli” che la aiutasse e che per 400 franchi le infilasse una sonda nell’utero. Si trovò da sola nello studentato femminile ad espellere il feto tra dolori atroci e sangue, obbligata a farsi tagliare il cordone ombelicale da una sua compagna. Un’esperienza che nessuna donna dovrebbe provare. Un libro corto ma una denuncia potentissima....more","Sep 06, 2024","Sep 10, 2024","Dec 06, 2022",Paperback,"Nov 11, 2019"

My overall conclusion is that forgiveness is personal - and may not truly be ""forgiveness"" but choosing to move forward and forget. Forgiveness can come instantly - or dozens of years later when it is just time to let go of the feelings of hurt. Note that all the stories are of truly horrific things that were done to - or by - folks to each other... What is not explored are all the day-to-day acts that require compassion and potentially forgiveness. Somehow the larger than life acts are either easier - or impossible - to transcend as they are truly life changing. One at that point needs to make conscious decision to shift how you live....

I enjoyed her poiI was provided an advance copy of this book in order to provide a review.This is the first book of Rachel Held Evans that I've read. I enjoyed her point of view and obvious commitment to research. Searching for Sunday is in my queue to read next.I am a seeker, trying to find answers to the puzzle of my faith, life, spirituality, and religion. Inspired has helped me fit a few pieces into the jigsaw.Evans begins each chapter with a vignette related to the upcoming chapter. I enjoyed them because they put Bible-ese into plain language. I especially enjoyed the play format of the Job story.There were a couple of chapters that didn't hold my attention as much as others. The Fish Stories in particular, seemed too long and scattered. I will try to read that chapter again to see if I can discover the message.Some of the strongest chapters were the Origin Stories, Deliverance Stories, and Church Stories. The messages spoke directly to my questions and my beliefs. I have many, many highlights, tabs, and margin notes in those chapters.My favorite passage in the entire book starts in the middle of page 162, where Held gives several perspectives on the gospels, from her sister who works for Samaritan's Purse, Nadia Bolz Weber who is a favorite of mine, Sara Miles who wrote Take This Bread, to Herod forbidding Jesus from raising the dead. The final paragraph states: ""Two thousand years and two billion followers later, one thing is clear: there's no such thing as just a story.""I highly recommend this book if you are seeking answers. It doesn't provide all the answers, but it gives perspective, which is more important....more","May 04, 2018not set","May 25, 2018not set","May 25, 2018",Paperback,"Jun 12, 2018"

I found myself smiling through most of the book. I was so intriguThis book was my first 5 star read of 2023.I fell in love with Clementine and Iwan. I found myself smiling through most of the book. I was so intrigued by the dual timelines. It was an absolute blast to get taken on a journey back and forth from seven years prior to current day. Ashley Poston did this so well! I've recently read a couple of other books that try to have two different timelines going at the same time and neither worked, but it Ashley accomplished it perfectly in The Seven Year Slip.I love that the magic of the apartment is never explained. It was done in a way that didn't leave you curious, just pleasantly surprised each time travel.I've heard people criticize some of the characters' decisions and had to laugh. Like, do you want perfect people or real people? I prefer characters to be realistic and the fact that they sometimes make choices you disagree with with an outside perspective is what makes the book amazing! The characters are so well developed and every action in the book fits with the background we learn about them. I love that they grow throughout the story and that their relationship grows with them. Honestly, so good!I haven't even mentioned the other characters in the book, wow. I felt connected to every single one.Little spoiler below:That he nicknames her Lemon is just the cutest and filled me with butterflies each time!...more",not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jan 07, 2024",Paperback,"Jun 27, 2023"

        (Cat and Mouse, #1)","Carlton, H.D.*",1,131459329,,"760,090",3.95,583pp,"Falling in love with your rapist is actually a survival instinct, a trauma response, not the start of some amazing love story. This book was the worstFalling in love with your rapist is actually a survival instinct, a trauma response, not the start of some amazing love story. This book was the worst thing I have ever read. I am disgusted and horrified by the author.Most negative reviews have said all I had to say about how awful Zade is, he is a typical stalker/rapist, nothing special about him. Does the author not realize there are serial rapists and murderers who have normal jobs, sometimes even jobs that save people, in addition to being a monster in their free time? Zade is a monster the exact same as they are, but H.D. doesn't think so. Disturbing.I will add how in addition to how evil he is to Addie, he doesn't even treat the victims he rescues with empathy and understanding, either.Let's talk about when he is rescuing the little girl who has been kidnapped by a sex trafficking ring. To this girl, surrounded by pedophiles who were going to murder her, he says:""Open your eyes, pretty girl.""""It's okay, pretty girl.""What kind of sick creep would say that to a little girl struggling through the most traumatizing abuse of her life?! Wouldn't you maybe guess that at least one of the dozens of pedophiles around her has oozed this exact compliment at her and currently she's associating pretty with horror? If you had a soul you would say, brave girl or strong girl.I would never in a million years imagine why someone would put the word pretty into a traumatic situation like that! It made me physically gag and get so filled with rage I had to put the book down.Why in the world I kept reading, I honestly don't know. I was truly hoping this guy would get his in the end, but nope, he was the HERO according to the book. Horrifying....more",not set,not set,"Jan 07, 2024",Kindle Edition,"Aug 12, 2021"

It scratched an itch I didn’t even know I had.Nicole does such an amazing job of describing Maddie’s POV, she relies heavily on descriptions from other people and the sounds and smells surrounding Maddie. And Saff’s character was equally as well-written. Love a badass woman (with a bad attitude) who can also be soft when she really cares about someone!My only complaint (and it’s such a small unimportant thing) with this book is, while advertised as an enemies-to-lovers, I didn’t quite get that vibe? Like Saff is mildly annoyed with Maddie for most of the book but it never felt like they were true “enemies” to me. Again, it didn’t impact my overall experience or love for the characters and the book as a whole.The ending nearly killed me!
