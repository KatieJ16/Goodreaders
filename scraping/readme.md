The jupyter notebook was me playing around to make it work, and is probably a little messy
The .py actually generates a dataset. It is building off of this tutorial: https://dev.to/bekaar_coder/how-to-scrape-data-from-goodreads-using-python-and-beautifulsoup-4mf9
It reads the books from best-books-2024 and makes a .csv of all the info after scrapping each book's webpage. Could add a lot more books to this dataset, but this is a good start.
